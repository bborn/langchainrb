  You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task or input. Here is the data:
  [BEGIN DATA]
  ***
  [Input]: {question}
  ***
  [Submission]: {answer}
  ***
  [Expected Answer]: {expected_answer}
  ***
  [END DATA]
  Does the submission match the Expected Answer? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about each criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer of whether the submission matches the expected answer. At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line."""
